The process of buying a resale Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat in Singapore is structured and involves several critical steps:

Eligibility Check: Confirm that you meet the criteria established by HDB, including citizenship, age, and family nucleus requirements.

Obtaining HDB Loan Eligibility (HLE) Letter: If you need financing, apply for the HLE letter, which indicates your borrowing capacity and is valid for six months.

Searching for a Resale Flat: Use online platforms and real estate agents to find a flat that matches your preferences and budget.

Verification of Flat Details: Check the flatâ€™s lease duration, condition, and any financial encumbrances to ensure everything is in order.

Making an Offer: Submit your offer to the seller and negotiate the price and terms of sale.

Signing the Option to Purchase (OTP): Once an agreement is reached, sign the OTP and pay an option fee, usually 1% of the purchase price.

Exercising the OTP: Complete the OTP within 21 days by signing the sale and purchase agreement and paying a deposit of around 4%.

Loan Application: If financing, submit your application along with the necessary documents to the bank or HDB.

Finalizing the Sale: Go to the HDB office to complete the sale, sign documents, and pay the remaining amount for the property.

Transfer of Ownership: HDB will facilitate the ownership transfer, and you will receive the keys to your flat.

Renovation and Moving In: After receiving the keys, you can renovate your flat as desired before moving in.

Post-Purchase Obligations: Be aware of ongoing commitments like the Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) which may impact your ownership.

By following these steps, you can navigate the process efficiently and secure your new home, ensuring compliance with all necessary legal and financial requirements. Engaging with professionals can also aid in a smoother transition into homeownership.
